# Where do ethical obligations come from?

(Adapted with permission from "An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics" by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan.)

*Before starting this experience, please read [What do we mean when we talk about ethics?](reading-se-ethics-intro.html).*

As you might expect by now, there is a simple answer to this question that will
nevertheless lead us into a far more complex and profound set of considerations. The
simple answer is, ‘because software engineers are human beings, and all human beings
have ethical obligations to each other.’ Unless you believe, for example, that you have no
ethical obligation to stop a small toddler who you happen to see crawling toward the
opening to a deep mineshaft, then you accept that you have some basic ethical obligations
toward other human beings.

What those obligations are, precisely, is a matter of ethical theory, and many such
theories have been developed over the course of human history. Some of these theories
developed in folk or religious traditions, others are articulated in scholarly philosophical
discourse from the ancient world to today. Among the most well-known and influential
types of theory are those of virtue ethics found in diverse cultures from Confucian ethics
to ancient Greek, Roman and Christian philosophy, along with the consequentialist
group of theories that include utilitarianism, and finally deontological theories of ethics
that emphasize rules and principles. We will briefly revisit these types of ethical theory
in the next section.

Our question here, however, was not ‘what are my ethical duties?’ but rather ‘why do I have
them?’ That is not a question for ethical theory, it is a question of metaethics, or the study
of where our ethical duties come from and why they obligate us to act as they say we
should. Many answers have been given to this question, but before we get lost in a
profound philosophical problem, let us remember that in our case we are exploring the
special ethical obligations of software engineers, which while not wholly independent of our
broader ethical obligations as human beings, may have a more clearly identifiable source
and justification.

The first explanation of this source involves the concept of a profession. What is a
professional? You may not have considered that this word is etymologically connected
with the English verb ‘to profess.’ What is it to profess something? It is to stand publicly
for something, to express a belief, conviction, value or promise to a general audience that
you expect that audience to hold you accountable for, and to identify you with. When I
profess something, I assert that this is something about which I am serious and sincere;
and which I want others to know about me. So when we identify someone as a professional
X (whether ‘X’ is a lawyer, physician, soldier or engineer), we are saying that being an ‘X’
is not just a job, but a vocation, a form of work to which the individual is committed and
with which they would like their lives to be identified.

This is part of why professionals are generally expected to undertake advanced education
and training in their field; not only because they need the expertise (though that too), but
also because this is a important sign of their investment and commitment to the field.
When students who have completed an arduous degree program enter the work world,
this is taken as evidence that they are sincere in their interest in this kind of work, that
they understand and uniquely value the contribution that this work makes to the world,
and that they want their own personal good and sense of self to be enduringly intertwined
and identified with the good of their chosen profession. Of course, people do change
professions – but not as frequently, or as lightly, as people change mere jobs.

So what does being a professional have to do with ethics? How does it create special
ethical obligations for the software engineer? First, I stated above that a professional has
stated implicitly a desire to have their own good intertwined and identified with the good
of their profession. But what is the good of their profession? Look back at your answers
to the question of [What can a software engineer contribute to the good life?](experience-se-ethics-good.html). Do they suggest an answer to this question?

Consider that members of most professions enjoy an elevated status in their communities;
doctors, professors, scientists and lawyers generally get more respect from the public
(rightly or wrongly) than retail clerks, manicurists, toll booth operators, and car
salespeople. But why? It can’t just be the difference in skill; after all, car salespeople have
to have very specialized skills in order to thrive in their job. The distinction lies in the
perception that professionals secure a vital public good, not something of merely private
and conditional value. For example, without doctors, public health would certainly suffer
– and a good life is virtually impossible without some measure of health. Without lawyers
and judges, the public would have no formal access to justice – and without recourse for
injustice done to you or others, how can the good life be secure? Without scientists, the
public would be deprived of reliable and carefully tested knowledge – and how can a life
filled with ignorance and error be good? So each of these professions is supported and
respected by the public precisely because they deliver something vital to the good life, and
something needed not just by a few, but by us all.

We are nearing the conclusion of our inquiry in this section. We started with the question
of why we have ethical obligations as software engineers. Well, software engineering is
a profession, and one that like all professions, receives distinctive public support and
respect. What do software engineers do to earn that respect? How must they act in order
to continue to earn it? After all, special public respect and support are not given for free
or given unconditionally – they are given in recognition of some service or value that
actually warrants support and respect. That support and respect is also something that
translates into real power; the power of public funding and consumer loyalty, the power
of influence over how people live and what systems they use to organize their lives; in
short, the power to guide the course of other human beings’ technological future. And as
we are told in the popular Spiderman saga, “With great power comes great responsibility.”
This is a further reason, even above their general ethical obligations as human beings,
that software engineers have special ethical obligations to the public they serve.

#### Questions for discussion

  1. Which of the contributions in [your answer above](experience-se-ethics-good.html) are related to vital
     public good(s)? What vital public goods might software engineers help to secure
     that you did not mention in your initial answer?
