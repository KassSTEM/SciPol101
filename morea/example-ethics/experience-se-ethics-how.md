# How can software engineers act ethically?

There are a number of common habits and practices that create obstacles to living well
in the moral sense; fortunately, there are also a number of common habits and practices
that are highly conducive to living well:

## Five Ethically Constructive Habits of Mind and Action:

**1. Self- Reflection/Examination:** This involves spending time on a regular basis (even
daily) thinking about the person you want to become, in relation to the person you are
today. It involves identifying character traits and habits that you would like to change or
improve in your private and professional life; reflecting on whether you would be happy
if those whom you admire and respect most knew all that you know about your actions,
choices and character; and asking yourself how fully you are living up to the values you
profess to yourself and others.

**2. Looking for Moral Exemplars:** Many of us spend a great deal of our time, often more
than we realize, judging the shortcomings of others. We wallow in irritation or anger at
what we perceive as unfair, unkind or incompetent behavior of others, we comfort
ourselves by noting the even greater professional or private failings of others, and we
justify ignoring the need for our own ethical improvement by noting that many others
seem to be in no hurry to become better people either. What we miss when we focus on
the shared faults of humanity are those exemplary actions we witness, and the exemplary
persons in our communities, that offer us a path forward in our own self-development.
Exemplary acts of forgiveness, compassion, grace, courage, creativity and justice have the
power to draw our aspirations upward; especially when we consider that there is no
reason why we would be incapable of these actions ourselves. But this cannot happen
unless we are in the habit of looking for, and taking notice of, moral exemplars in the
world around us.

**3. Exercising our Moral Imaginations:** It can be hard to notice our ethical obligations,
or their importance, because we have difficulty imagining how what we do might affect
others. In some sense we all know that our personal and professional choices almost
always have consequences for the lives of others, whether good or bad. But rarely do we
try to really imagine what it will be like to suffer the pain that our action is likely going to
cause someone – or what it will be like to experience the joy, or relief of pain or worry
that another choice of ours might bring. This becomes even harder as we consider
stakeholders who live outside of our personal circles and beyond our daily view. The pain
of your best friend who you have betrayed is easy to see, and not difficult to imagine before
you act - but it is easy not to see, and not to imagine, the pain of a person on another
continent, unknown to you, whose life has been ruined by identity theft because you
knowingly allowed a product with gaping security holes to be released without providing
customers a patch. The suffering of that person, and your responsibility for it, would be
no less great simply because you had difficulty imagining it. Fortunately, our powers of
imagination can be increased. Seeking out news, books, films and other sources of stories 
about the human condition can help us to better envision the lives of others, even those
in very different circumstances from our own. This capacity for imaginative empathy, when
habitually exercised, enlarges our ability to envision the likely impact of our actions on
other stakeholders. Over time, this can help us to fulfill our ethical obligations and to live
as better people.

**4. Acknowledging Your Own Moral Strength:** For the most part, living well in the
ethical sense makes life easier, not harder. Acting like a person of courage, compassion and
integrity is, in most circumstances, also the sort of action that garners respect, trust and
friendship in both private and professional circles, and these are actions that we ourselves
can enjoy and look back upon with satisfaction rather than guilt, disappointment or
shame. But it is inevitable that sometimes the thing that is right will not be the easy
thing, at least not in the short term. And all too often our moral will to live well gives
out at exactly this point – under pressure, we take the easy (and wrong) way out, and try
as best we can to put our moral failure and the harm we may have done or allowed out of
our minds.

One of the most common reasons why we fail to act as we know we should is that we
think we are too weak to do so, that we lack the strength to make difficult choices and face
the consequences of doing what is right. But this is often more of a self-justifying and
self-fulfilling fantasy than a reality; just as a healthy person may tell herself that she
simply can’t run five miles, thus sparing her the effort of trying what millions of others
just like her have accomplished, a person may tell herself that she simply can’t tell the
truth when it will greatly inconvenience or embarrass her, or that she simply can’t help
someone in need when it will cost her something she wants for herself. But of course
people do these things every day; they tell the morally important truth and take the heat,
they sell their boat so that their disabled friend’s family does not become homeless, they
report frauds from which they might otherwise have benefited financially. These people
are not a different species from the rest of us; they just have not forgotten or discounted
their own moral strength. And in turn, they live very nearly as they should, and as we at
any time can, if we simply have the will.

**5. Seeking the Company of Other Moral Persons** – many have noted the importance
of friendship in moral development; in the 4th century B.C. the Greek philosopher
Aristotle argued that a virtuous friend can be a ‘second self,’ one who represents the very
qualities of character that we value and aspire to preserve in ourselves.10 He notes also
that living well in the ethical sense requires ethical actions, and that activity is generally
easier and more pleasurable in the company of others. Thus seeking the company of other
moral persons can keep us from feeling isolated and alone in our moral commitments;
friends of moral character can increase our pleasure and self-esteem when we do well
alongside them, they can call us out when we act inconsistently with our own professed
ideals and values, they can help us reason through difficult moral choices, and they can
take on the inevitable challenges of ethical life with us, allowing us to weather them
together. Aside from this, and as compared with persons who are ethically compromised,
persons of moral character are direct sources of pleasure and comfort – we benefit daily
from their kindness, honesty, mercy, wisdom and courage, just as they find comfort and
happiness in ours.

#### Questions for discussion

  1. Of these five moral habits and practices, which do you think you are
     best at presently? Which of these habits, if any, would you like to do more to
     cultivate?
     
  2. In what specific ways, small or large, do you think adopting some
     or all of these habits could change a person’s personal and professional life?
