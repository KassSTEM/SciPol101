#### Questions for discussion

  1. Imagine that you were in Bill's shoes. Do you feel someone in his position has an ethical obligation to act differently? If so, how should he have responded to the customer's requirements?  If possible, justify your answer by reference to either the [ACM Code of Ethics](http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) or the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics).
