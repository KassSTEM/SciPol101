# To whom are software engineers obligated?

(Adapted with permission from [An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics](http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/technology/software-engineering-ethics.html) by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan.)

*Before starting this experience, please read [What do we mean when we talk about ethics?](reading-se-ethics-intro.html).*

The [NSPE’s paramountcy clause](http://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics) asks engineers to recognize that their primary
professional duty is to ‘hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public.’ But
who exactly is this ‘public?’ Of course, one can respond simply with, ‘the public is
everyone.’ But the public is not an undifferentiated mass; the public is composed of our
families, our friends and co-workers, our employers, our neighbors, our church or other
local community members, our countrymen and women, and people living in every other
part of the world. To say that we have ethical obligations to ‘everyone’ is to tell us very
little about how to actually work responsibly as an engineer in the public interest, since
each of these groups and individuals that make up the public are in a unique relationship
to us and our work, and are potentially impacted by it in very different ways. We also
have special obligations to some members of the public (our children, our employer, our
friends, our fellow citizens) that exist alongside the broader, more general obligations we
have to all of them.

One concept that ethicists often use to clarify our obligations to the public is that of a
stakeholder. A stakeholder is anyone who is potentially impacted by my actions.
Clearly, certain persons have more at stake than other stakeholders in any given action I
might take; when I consider, for example, how much effort to put into cleaning up a buggy
line of code in a program that will be used to control a pacemaker, it is obvious that the
patients in whom the pacemakers with this programming will be implanted are the
primary stakeholders in my action; their very lives are potentially at risk in my choice.
And this stake is so ethically significant that it is hard to see how any other stakeholder’s
interest could weigh as heavily.

Still, in most ethical contexts, including those that arise in software engineering, there
are a variety of stakeholders potentially impacted by my action, and their interests may
not always align with each other. For example, my employer’s interests in cost-cutting
and an on-time product delivery schedule may frequently be in tension with the interest
of other stakeholders in having the highest quality and most reliable product. Yet even
these stakeholder conflicts are rarely so simple as they might first appear; the consumer
also has an interest in an affordable product, and my employer also has an interest in
earning a reputation for product excellence, and in maintaining the profile of a responsible
corporate citizen.

Of course, while my own trivial, short-sighted and self-defeating interests (say, in gaining
extra leisure time by taking reckless coding shortcuts) will never trump a critical moral
interest of another stakeholder (say, their interest in not being unjustly killed by my
product), it remains true that I myself am a stakeholder, since my actions also impact my
own life and well-being. A decision to ignore my well-defined contractual obligations to
my employer, or my obligations to my fellow product team members, will have weighty
consequences for me. But ignoring the health, safety and welfare of those who rely upon
the code I produce has consequences that are potentially even graver – for me as well as
for those persons whose well-being I have chosen to discount or ignore.
Ethical decision-making thus requires cultivating the habit of reflecting carefully upon the range
of stakeholders who together make up the ‘public’ to whom I am obligated, and weighing what is
at stake for each of us in my choice.

Here is a scenario to help you think about what this reflection process can entail: 

## Case Study 3: Developing software for repression

<blockquote>
<p>You are a new hire in a product design team for a start-up company that is
developing new and more powerful versions of the kind of packet-sniffing
and email scanning software systems used by law enforcement agencies and
large corporations to monitor data traffic for illegal activities. This kind of
software might, for example, be programmed to detect illegal downloads of
copyrighted materials, or to flag for review email keywords like ‘bomb,’
‘steal,’ or ‘bribe.’ You are a young parent of two small children, with parents
and friends who are deeply proud of your achievements. You are looking 
forward to using this first job to cultivate a reputation in your industry for
being an excellent software engineer.</p>

<p>One day, you happen to overhear your supervisor chatting with another
supervisor about a new contract the company has recently received from a
foreign government. You happen to recognize the name of this country as
one that is currently run by an oppressive military regime that routinely
imprisons its citizens without trial or other due process. In this country,
people perceived as political dissidents and their families are often sent to
labor camps with deplorable living conditions, without hope of appeal, for an
indefinite period. Your own nation has strongly criticized this country’s
human rights record, and many international organizations as well as the
United Nations have condemned its practices.</p>

<p>You realize now that the product your team is working on is part of your
company’s contract with this government; and in fact, you have been
assigned specifically to develop the part of the product that searches for
specific keyword strings in private emails, texts, social networking
messages, Skype and phone conversations. Reviewing the specs for your
task, you realize that your contribution to the product will almost certainly
be used to identify for extraction and review conversations between private
citizens of this country in which there is any specific discussion of their
government or its policies, and especially those in which words like ‘reform,’
‘injustice,’ ‘corruption,’ ‘due process’ or ‘human rights’ occur.</p> 
</blockquote>

#### Questions for discussion

  1. Who are the various stakeholders in this scenario, and what do they
     each have at stake in your action? Reflect carefully and deeply, and answer as fully
     as possible.
     
  2. What do you think are your ethical obligation(s) in this situation? If possible, justify your obligation(s) by reference to either the [ACM Code of Ethics](http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) or the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics). 
  
  3. Do you feel you have ethical obligations not covered by either code? If so, please explain.
