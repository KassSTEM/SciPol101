# Case study: Autonomous cars

*Before starting this experience, please go through all of the "Foundations" readings and experiences.*

The algorithms underlying autonomous (self-driving) cars must address significant ethical dilemmas, such as how the car should behave in the event of an unavoidable accident.  Please read the following articles for more details:  

  * [Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/)
  * [Autonomous vehicles need experimental ethics: are we ready for utilitarian cars?](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03346v1.pdf)
  
If you are interested in learning more about self-driving cars, here's an informative story from 60 minutes:

#### Questions for discussion

  1. Imagine that you are a software engineering on a team that is tasked with developing the navigation algorithm for a self-driving car.  What are your ethical obligations?  If possible, justify your answer by reference to either the [ACM Code of Ethics](http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) or the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics). If you believe at least one of your ethical obligations are not covered by either code, please indicate that.
